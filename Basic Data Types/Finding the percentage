#You have a record of N students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. 
#The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer N followed by the names and marks for students. 
#You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. 
#Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.
#Input Format
#The first line contains the integer N, the number of students. The next N lines contains the name and marks obtained by 
#that student separated by a space. The final line contains the name of a particular student previously listed.
#Constraints 2<=N=10, 0<=marks<=100
#Output Format
#Print one line: The average of the marks obtained by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places.
