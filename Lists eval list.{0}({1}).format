#Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
#insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
#print: Print the list.
#remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
#append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
#sort: Sort the list.
#pop: Pop the last element from the list.
#reverse: Reverse the list.
#Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the  types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.
#Input Format
#The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of commands. 
#Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.
#Constraints
#The elements added to the list must be integers.
#Output Format
#For each command of type print, print the list on a new line.
